\title{Gradient test}

\description{ 
\code{gt.bpm} can be used to test the hypothesis of absence of endogeneity, correlated model equations/errors or non-random sample selection
in binary bivariate probit models.}


\usage{

gt.bpm(x)

}

\arguments{ 

\item{x}{A fitted \code{gjrm} object.} 

}


\details{

The gradient test was first proposed by Terrell (2002) and it is based on classic likelihood 
theory. See Marra et al. (2017) for full details. 

}


\value{

It returns a numeric p-value corresponding to the null hypothesis that the correlation, \eqn{\theta}{\theta}, is equal to 0. 


}



\section{WARNINGS}{

This test's implementation is only valid for bivariate binary probit models with normal errors.
