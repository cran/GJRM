\title{Joint or conditional probabilities from a fitted joint model}

\description{ 
\code{jc.probs} can be used to calculate the joint or conditional probabilities from a fitted joint model with intervals obtained 
using posterior simulation.}



\usage{

jc.probs(x, y1, y2, y3 = NULL, newdata, type = "joint", cond = 0,
         intervals = FALSE, n.sim = 100, prob.lev = 0.05, min.pr = 1e-323, max.pr = 1, 
         cumul = "no")

}

\arguments{ 

\item{x}{A fitted \code{gjrm} object as 
         produced by the respective fitting function.}

\item{y1}{Value of response for first margin.}

\item{y2}{Value of response for second margin.}

\item{y3}{Value of response for third margin if a trivariate model is employed.}


\item{newdata}{A data frame or list containing the values of the model covariates at which predictions are required. 
               If not provided then predictions corresponding to the original data are returned.
               When newdata is provided, it should contain all the variables needed for prediction.}

\item{type}{This argument can take two: \code{"joint"} (the probabilities are calculated from the fitted 
            joint model) and \code{"independence"} (the calculation is done from univariate fits).}

\item{cond}{There are three possible values: 0 (joint probabilities are delivered), 1 (conditional probabilities are delivered and 
            conditioning is with the respect to the first margin), 2 (as before but conditioning is with the respect to 
            the second margin).}  
  
\item{intervals}{If \code{TRUE} then intervals for the probabilities are also produced.}   
  
\item{n.sim}{Number of simulated coefficient vectors from the posterior distribution of the estimated model parameters. This is used
             for interval calculations.} 

\item{prob.lev}{Overall probability of the left and right tails of the probabilities' distributions used for interval calculations.} 
  

 \item{min.pr, max.pr}{Allowed minimum and maximum for estimated probabities.}


\item{cumul}{Only used for discrete and continuous margins' case.} 


  
}


\details{

This function calculates joint or conditional probabilities from a fitted joint model or a model assuming independence, with intervals 
obtained using posterior simulation.

}



\value{

\item{res}{It returns several values including: estimated probabilities (\code{p12}), with lower and upper interval limits (\code{CIpr}) 
if \code{intervals = TRUE}, and \code{p1}, \code{p2} and \code{p3} (the marginal probabilities).}
