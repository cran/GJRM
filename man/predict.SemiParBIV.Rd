\title{Prediction function}

\description{

It takes a fitted \code{gjrm} object and, 
for each equation, produces predictions 
for a new set of values of the model covariates or the original values used for the model fit. 
Standard errors of predictions can be produced and are based on the posterior distribution of the model coefficients. This function is a 
wrapper for \code{predict.gam()} in \code{mgcv}. Please see the documentation of \code{predict.gam()} for full details.

\section{WARNINGS}{

When \code{type = "response"} this function will provide prediction assuming that the identity link function is adopted.
This means that \code{type = "link"} and \code{type = "response"} will produce the same results, which for some distributions is fine.
This is because, for internal reasons, the model object used always assumes an identity link. There are other functions in the package
which will produce predictions for the response correctly and we are currently working on extending them to all models in the package.
For all the other \code{type} values the function will produce the correct results. 

When predicting based on a new data set, this function can not return correct predictions for models based 
on a copula value of "C0C90", "C0C270", "C180C90", "C180C270", "G0G90", "G0G270", "G180G90",
"G180G270", "J0J90", "J0J270", "J180J90" or "J180J270".
